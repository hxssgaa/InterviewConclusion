I would like to go and I often go to France because I met a friend of mine, eh. 2 years ago, and she already invited me several times and I would always fascinated by French, and I start reading French books, I know Russian, but not French since I was twelve. And I’have been already in the south and right now I’m going to the north of the country, and I would like to try yogurt, cheese, wine

I prefer to go to Kunming because it’s my hometown.

Kunming is a gorgeous city and it’s like spring all the year around.
